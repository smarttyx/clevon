Data:
${input}

Requirements:
- Use clear markdown headings and sections
- Include an executive summary at the top
- Report only on data that was actually provided — do not invent or template missing sections
- If a data source failed, mention it briefly and continue with what is available
- Highlight key findings and actionable insights from the available data
- Format numbers clearly

Produce a well-formatted markdown report now:`;

${sectionsText}

Requirements:
- Begin with an executive summary synthesizing all sections
- Preserve and organize all key data points from each section
- Add clear markdown formatting with tables where appropriate
- Include a risk assessment and key recommendations at the end
- Be concise but comprehensive

Produce the final formatted report now:`;
